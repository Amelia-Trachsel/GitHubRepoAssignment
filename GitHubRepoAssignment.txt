#GitHubRepoAssignment

I should have done a bit better job at writing my steps as I went, lol.

I created a new directory in the terminal with the mkdir command, initialized. Then, I logged into GitHub and basically followed the instructions for creating a readme file from Git and used this in the GitBash terminal, pushed to origin after updating my password.

Did the same thing for this text file. Now I'm saving the file. :)
